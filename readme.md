#### What Are Microservices?
Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, <br>
manageable pieces, independent of others.<br>

#### Why Build Microservices?
Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, <br>
improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more. <br>
Microservice architectures are the ‘new normal’. Building small, self-contained, ready to run applications <br>
can bring great flexibility and added resilience to your code.<br>
